# Sentiment Analysis for Technology Survival
This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project, which is part of a larger survival analysis project. The objective of this project is to gather feedback from social media and tech news to determine if a new technology will survive or not.

Project Overview
The sentiment analysis involves three types of data: text, audio, and video. We used different models for each type of data:

Text Data: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
Video Data: SVM (Support Vector Machine) with HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features and facial landmarks
Audio Data: CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Tools and Libraries
Python
PyTorch
Huggingface Transformers
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
OpenCV
Mediapipe
Joblib
Scikit-image
